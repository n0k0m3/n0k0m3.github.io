</div>
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
data.created_at = pd.to_datetime(data.created_at)
data = data.sort_values(["created_at"])
```

</details>

#### Analysis 1: Order Amount Distribution Analysis

Assuming zero-knowledge of the data view, let's graph the `order_amount` distribution.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
fig = px.histogram(data.order_amount,title="Order Amount Histogram")
fig.show()
fig.write_json("plot_data/order_amount_histogram.json")
```

</details>

{{< plotly json="plot_data/order_amount_histogram.json" >}}

We can see that the almost all order value is less than or equal \$5000, let's graph the data with this bound.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
fig = px.histogram(data.order_amount[data.order_amount<=5000],title="Order Amount (with Amount < $5000) Histogram")
fig.show()
fig.write_json("plot_data/order_amount_histogram_5000.json")
```

</details>

{{< plotly json="plot_data/order_amount_histogram_5000.json" >}}

We see that the distribution are left skewed and also bimodal: \[0,220) represents first model and (220,5000+) represents the second model
(From the shape of distribution we can assume the first one is normal distribution, the second model is Weibull/Gamma distribution. However, this assumption won't play any role in the solutions).

**The bimodal and skewed distribution, along with outlier points tell us that arithmetic mean of order amount is not a good indicator of the average order amount (AOV). As such, other metrics should be used to analyze the order amount average.**

Also, we can see that the distribution is mostly concentrated in the range \[0,1100\], which we'll use later to analyze AOV.

#### Analysis 2: Time Series of Order Amount Analysis

From a quick scroll of the original data, we can see that `shop_id` 42 and 78 are outliers that have large order values that **potentially skew the AOV** (cause the AOV to be much larger than it supposed to be). This behavior can also be observed from the graph of Daily Order Amount by Shop.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
fig = px.line(data,y="order_amount",x="created_at",color="shop_id",title="Daily Order Amount by Shop")
fig.show()
fig.write_json("plot_data/daily_order_amount_by_shop.json")
```

</details>

{{< plotly json="plot_data/daily_order_amount_by_shop.json" >}}

Graphing the data without outlier shops, we have a more concentrated view of the data.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
fig = px.line(data[~data.shop_id.isin([42,78])],y="order_amount",x="created_at",color="shop_id",title="Daily Order Amount by non-outlier Shop")
fig.show()
fig.write_json("plot_data/daily_order_amount_by_shop_no_outlier.json")
```

</details>

{{< plotly json="plot_data/daily_order_amount_by_shop_no_outlier.json" >}}

In fact, we can see that other 98 shops don't have any order that exceed \$1100, which agrees with previous analysis on `order_amount` empirical distribution.

### Part B

With previous analyses, I propose 3 solutions to analyze AOV:
- **Median** of order amount as AOV
- As the first analysis show that the order amount is left skewed and the count of large `order_amount` is small, we can use the median as the AOV.
- This requires minimum change in code base and is the simplest solution.
- However, to implement this we need to communicate with stakeholders to brief the reason of using median.
- This metric doesn't consider temporary spikes (example: shops suddenly got an influx of orders for Christmas, etc.)
- AOV using **arithmetic mean** with `order_amount` capped at \$1100.
- Depends on the business needs (i.e.Â AOV per product category for small businesses), we can remove large outlier shops.
- Doesn't change the metric type
- Alienate large business users, and doesn't consider temporary spikes
- In larger scale, we need to build a robust solution to detect and remove outliers from reported AOV.
- AOV using **arithmetic mean** with `shop_id` 42 and 78 **removed as outliers**.
- Same pros and cons as the 2nd solution, except that we **will able to catch temporary spikes in order amount**.

We can also add other interesting additions to the above solutions (won't be implemented for this challenge):
- Per-shop AOV
- Report to shop owner for their personalized metrics
- Shop performance metrics on platform
- Daily AOV with outliers removed
- Analyzing trends of order amount by day
- Identify peak days and potential bottoms

### Part C

**Median** of order amount as AOV (Note that this median is on the whole dataset with outliers included)

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
print("Median as AOV: ${}".format(data.order_amount.median()))
```

</details>

    Median as AOV: $284.0

**Arithmetic mean** of order amount with outliers removed

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
print("Arithmetic mean as AOV on capped order amount of $1100: ${}".format(data.order_amount[data.order_amount<=1100].mean()))
print("Arithmetic mean as AOV with outlier shops removed: ${}".format(data[~data.shop_id.isin([42,78])].order_amount.mean()))
```

</details>

    Arithmetic mean as AOV on capped order amount of $1100: $301.83704904742604
    Arithmetic mean as AOV with outlier shops removed: $300.1558229655313

**Note:** For median, even with outliers removed, we still get the same result as above

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` python
print("Median as AOV on capped order amount of $1100: ${}".format(data.order_amount[data.order_amount<=1100].median()))
print("Median as AOV with outlier shops removed: ${}".format(data[~data.shop_id.isin([42,78])].order_amount.median()))
```

</details>

    Median as AOV on capped order amount of $1100: $284.0
    Median as AOV with outlier shops removed: $284.0

**Conclusion:** Depends on business need, either "Median as AOV" or "Arithmetic mean as AOV with outlier shops" can be used to analyze AOV.
