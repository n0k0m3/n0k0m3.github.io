Hello, and welcome to my digital corner of curiosity and creation!

I'm a Ph.D. student at Florida Tech, delving deep into the realms of Operations Research. My journey of learning is currently focused on the intriguing world of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and the exciting potential they offer in Synthetic Data Generation.

My [portfolio](/projects) is a showcase of my endeavors, a collection of past and present projects that I'm incredibly proud of. For tech enthusiasts, my [blog](/blog) is a treasure trove of insights and explorations, where I share my experiences with Linux, Docker, VM, and Kubernetes.

Whether you're here out of curiosity, interest, or are considering bringing me on board, I invite you to view my [resume](/resume).

Thank you for visiting, and enjoy your journey through my world of tech and innovation!
