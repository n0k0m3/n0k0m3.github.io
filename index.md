# n0k0m3's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal dev blog.

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the Florida Tech studying Operations Research, researching Learnable Representations of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and the applications in Synthetic Data Generation.

On the sidebar, you can find a list of [my current and past projects](/projects). Also, I highly recommend checking out my [Personal Projects](/Personal-Setup) that contains a lot of my personal setups and experiments with Linux, especially Arch Linux.

Also, if you are interested in hiring, you can find my [resume](/resume) on the sidebar.
