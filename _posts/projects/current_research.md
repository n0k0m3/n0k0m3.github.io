## Current Research

### Learning Representations of Electronic Health Records for Synthetic Data Generation

The goal of this project is to develop a learnable representations (embeddings) of electronic health records (EHRs), use the embeddings to generate synthetic embeddings with GANs, and develop a scalable Synthetic Patient Records pipeline from generated embeddings.
