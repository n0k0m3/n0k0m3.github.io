      <description>Following guide was tested on EndeavourOS and Manjaro (Arch-based) Linux distro.
Why? Installing dependencies and setting up notebooks is usually a PITA: installing CUDA with CuDNN and TensorRT doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a common and easy to follow guide, along with recent (not recent) release of python 3.9, most ML/DL packages are not updated to this wheel. Also setting up venv is hard to maintain and migrate as you have to backup the whole environment to other machine.</description>

      <title>VFIO Single GPU Passthrough Guide on Linux</title>

      <description>Why single GPU passthrough? Because I&amp;rsquo;m poor, using Ryzen non-APU CPU, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a second GPU just for passthrough. I&amp;rsquo;m using a single GPU passthrough for gaming on Windows and using Linux as my daily driver.
In this guide, we will be going over how to set up a single GPU passthrough on Linux. This guide is meant to be a reference for myself and others who want to learn how to set up a single GPU passthrough on Linux.</description>
